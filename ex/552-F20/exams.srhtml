<h2>Assessments</h2>
<p>Your final grade for the course will be based on the following weights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>35% course project</li>
  <li>20% paper reviews on hotCRP</li>
  <li>15% paper review discussions on hotCRP</li>
  <li>15% programming homeworks + 10% extra credit homework</li>
  <li>15% office hour participation</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no written exams. All material is submitted over
hotCRP and Sakai. </p>

<h3>Course Project (35%)</h3>

<p>The semester-long programming project is a significant component of
this course. The project could be an open-ended research project, a
reproduction of empirical results from a paper you've read (within or
outside the syllabus), a reimplementation of an existing system to a
new platform, a new tool that makes further research possible or easy,
or anything else of your choosing that is relevant to the course
material. The instructor will put out a list of ideas that could be
interesting course projects, but you are free to work on an idea of
your own that is relevant to the class material. <b>You must work in
teams of 2 or more.</b> Concretely, you will (1) submit a 1-page
project proposal on Tuesday September 15th, 2020 at 8 pm ET (the exact
formatting and requirements will be announced); (2) meet with the
instructor every week during one office hour of your choice; (3)
record and submit a final presentation and demo of your project by
Thursday December 10th, 2020 at 8 pm ET; and (4) submit a final 6-page
report by Tuesday December 15th, 2020 by 8 pm ET (the exact formatting
and requirements will be announced). Projects will be assessed on the
amount of programming effort involved, intellectual insights,
creativity, utility/importance of the problem solved, quality of the
experimental evaluation, and quality of the program source code.</p>

<h3>hotCRP conference-style paper reviews and discussions (35%)</h3>

<p>Students will perform conference-committee-style reviewing through
the hotCRP system (details to be announced). You will answer specific
questions about a technical paper you read for the class, one per
week, with the exception of weeks when project requirements or
programming homeworks are due. When a review is assigned for a given
week, the review will be due the Tuesday of the week. The first review
will be due Tuesday September 8th at 8 pm ET. Once you submit your
review, you will be able to see everyone else's reviews for that
paper, and be able to conduct an online discussion about the paper
(<i>note that all your peers will see the review you wrote, as
well</i>). The instructor will moderate the online discussion on the
hotCRP platform. <b>Your participation both in reviewing and
discussion are required and graded.</b> Grades are assigned based on
the clarity, intellectual depth, and constructive virtues of the
technical discussion and the arguments you make. As a class, we will
openly and deeply discuss the strengths, weaknesses, areas to improve,
and ways to build atop each paper. The discussion period will close on
Fridays at 8 pm ET each week. There will be 9 paper reviews in
total. Note that the last review alone has a different day schedule
due to the Thanksgiving recess. </p>

Mitzenmacher's <a href="papers/mitzenmacher-reading.pdf">helpful notes on
critically reading papers.</a></p>

<h3>Programming homeworks (15% + 10% extra credit)</h3>

The course will have two mandatory programming homeworks (worth 15%
together) and an optional extra credit programming homework (worth
10%). Specific requirements for these homeworks will be announced when
the homeworks are released. Homeworks are due on Tuesday October 6th
2020 at 8 pm ET, Tuesday October 27th 2020 at 8 pm ET, and (extra
credit) Tuesday November 17th at 8 pm ET.

<h3>Office hour participation (15%)</h3>

<p><b>Every student is expected to attend one office hour per
week.</b> The office hours are listed on the <a
href="index.html">course home page.</a> If none of the listed hours
work for you, you must contact the course instructor
immediately. During the office hour, you are free to bring any
technical questions on the materials in this class, from lecture, a
research paper, or regarding the homeworks and projects. <b>You must
show up to office hours to report your progress on the course
project.</b> The instructor will also be available to help with any
technical obstacles you face on your projects and programming
homeworks. You are free to ask the instructor to set up one-on-one or
smaller group meetings if the common office hours are
insufficient for discussion. </p>

<h2>Course plagiarism and integrity policy</h2>

You must abide by the <a
href="http://nbacademicintegrity.rutgers.edu/home/academic-integrity-policy/">Rutgers
New Brunswick academic integrity policy</a> and also the <a
href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy">Rutgers
CS policy.</a>

<p>In general, in this course, open discussions and collaborations are
welcome and encouraged. However, <b>all written work and software must
be your own.</b> If you used a library software you found on the
Internet for a programming assignment or a project, you must reference
and credit the source appropriately. If you discussed a paper with
your friend, you must mention who you worked with in your paper
review. Violations of these policies will be taken very
seriously. Ignorance of these policies will not be considered
excusable if you are found in violation. </p>

<h2>Late policy</h2>

<p>You may submit the two mandatory programming homeworks up to a week
late without any penalty. You may submit the course project proposal a
week late without penalty. Please inform the instructor if you intend
to submit late. Unfortunately, due to the synchronous nature of the
online paper reviews and discussions, <b>there will be no extensions
or late days for your paper reviews and discussion contributions.</b>
Further, University's grading deadlines for the Fall semester require
timely submission of final student work by the end of the semester,
hence there may be penalties for delayed submission of project
demos/presentations and final reports.</p>
