<h2>Assessments</h2>
<p>Your final grade for the course will be based on the following weights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>20% class participation</li>
  <li>40% project</li>
  <li>40% reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>There will be no exams.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>

<p>The project could be an open-ended research project, a reproduction of empirical
results from a paper you've read (within or outside the syllabus), a
reimplementation of an existing system to a new platform, a new tool that makes
further research possible or easy, or anything else of your choosing that
<i>must</i> involve a significant (networking-related) programming component.</p>

<p>You can work in groups of 2--3 or alone.</p>

<p>You must write a 1-page proposal in consultation with the instructor. The
proposal is due on 11/02.  The exact requirements for the proposal will be
announced in class. Please talk to the instructor about your project ideas and
directions <i>well before</i> you submit your proposal to make any necessary
course corrections.</p>

<p>You must also complete a 6-page report at the end of the semester. The exact
requirements for this report will be announced in class.</p>

<p>Projects will be assessed on their intellectual insights, creativity,
utility, and the quality of the program source code.</p>

<h3>Reviews</h3>

<p>You must complete four paper reviews through the span of the semester. Please
see the first lecture for a typical way to structure a paper review.</p>

<p>You are welcome and encouraged to talk to the instructor and your peers about
the papers you review. However, <b>all written work must be your own</b> (no
exceptions). Do acknowledge everyone you discussed with in order to form the
opinions that you put down in your review. Please do not consult public reviews
(where available); however, you are welcome to read them once you submit your
review to gain a broader perspective.</p>

<p>Reviews will be assessed on the demonstrated depth of understanding of the
paper's technical contributions, as well as the intellectual insights offered
both about the innovations and the failings of the paper.</p>

<p>You may find it helpful to read Timothy Roscoe's writeup on <a
href="papers/roscoe07.pdf">how to review a systems paper.</a></p>

<p>The reviews are due on Fridays 09/21, 10/12, 10/19, and 11/09.</p>
