<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Internet is an exciting place with its many services that we, as
consumers, take for granted. But how does this global communication
infrastructure work? What principles did the Internet's designers follow to
implement a system that enables developers to build as easily atop it? What does
it take to build an Internet service and protocol that you could use yourself?
How do network operators and services ensure that they provide the best possible
user experience?</p>

<p> This course will provide students with a thorough understanding of the basic
principles of computer networks, the design philosophy of the Internet, and the
details of Internet protocols. Students who complete this course will be able to
describe in detail the operations of Internet protocols and develop their own
Internet applications. Through a series of lectures and programming projects,
students will find answers to the aforementioned questions.</p>
