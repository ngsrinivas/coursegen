<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Internet has become an indispensable part of our life,
especially after the global pandemic. As its consumers, we might often
take its existence and utility for granted.</p>

<p>But how does this global communication infrastructure really
work?</p>

<p>This course will provide students with an understanding of the
principles and practical artifacts by which the Internet and other
computer networks are designed and operated today. The course will
combine conceptual understanding with hands-on programming exercises
and activities.</p>

Questions we will discuss include the following and more:
<ul>

<li>How does web browsing work under the hood? </li>

<li>How do video streaming services like YouTube and Netflix
manage to provide good quality even over a slow Internet
connection?  </li>

<li>How do Internet-based applications ensure reliable data delivery,
even when the underlying network is unreliable?</li>

<li>How does your laptop know where to find your favorite service on
the Internet, and how does the service know where to find you
back?</li>

<li>How is communication over the Internet (e.g., financial
transactions) secured?</li>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<p>This course will use Canvas and Piazza. You should be signed up for
Piazza automatically through your enrollment on Canvas.</p>

<!--
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The
system is highly catered to getting you help fast and
efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than
emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to
post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or
feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find our class signup link at:

<p>Lecture materials and a full class schedule will be
available on the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus
page.</a></p>

<p>All course announcements will occur on Canvas.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Your final course will be based on the following
components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30% written exams (two mid terms and one final)</li>
  <li>15% problem sets (3 over the semester)</li>
  <li>40% programming projects (5 over the semester)</li>
  <li>15% lecture questions (due on the day before each lecture)</li>
</ul>

<p>This course uses absolute grading thresholds; there is no
curve.</p>

<p>Any materials due on a specific day are due at 11:59 pm Eastern
Time on that day.</p>

<p>The schedule of the problem sets, programming projects, and
lectures are available in the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus
page.</a>Schedules are tentative and subject to change. </p>

<p>There will be two mid-terms and one final exam. You are allowed a
single letter-paper cheat sheet for referencing during these
exams. The sheet must be prepared (handwritten or typed) by you. The
mid-terms will be in class during lecture hour. The final exam will be
be held during the University-designated slot over the finals
period. </p>

<p>Problem sets will be due the week before each major exam of the
course. They will include questions from the majority of the material
covered for the forthcoming exam and may serve as a reference for the
kinds of questions you may expect on the exam. Problem sets are
released and handed in on Canvas.</p>

<p>For exams, problem sets, and project report responses,
<b>please keep your answers clear and concise.</b> You will
receive 25% of the credit for any question which you leave
blank or clearly write "I don't know". <b>Vague and rambling
answers will receive zero credit.</b> Calculators are
allowed.

<p>There are five programming projects. You will work in teams of 2
and have roughly 2--3 weeks to finish each project. Under extenuating
circumstances, you can change teams, but normally we expect you to
stick to the same partner over the semester. The projects will mostly
use the Python3 language and Linux shell scripting. You will be using
a Linux environment we provide access to for all the programming
assignments. Projects are released and handed in on Canvas. A
programming solution and a write-up (questions detailed under each
project) will be required for each project. </p>

<p>We will provide instructions for packaging and handing in your
programming projects. You must follow these instructions exactly. If
we cannot run your programs, you will lose a significant portion of
points. If you hand in a programming assignment late, you will lose a
significant fraction of points.</p>

<p>Per-lecture quizzes are due at the end of the day before the next
lecture. They should ideally take just 5--10 minutes of your time, but
you are provided 30 minutes. We will consider the 20 highest scores
among all quizzes (there are 26 lectures and quizzes in
total). Lecture quizzes are open book and you may freely consult the
materials provided in class (lectures, textbooks, etc.). However, you
may not search for answers on the Internet. Lecture quizzes are handed
in on Canvas. </p>

<p>In general, late submissions to any component of the course are
disallowed unless exempt by medical or religious reasons allowable by
the University or the explicit permission of the faculty
instructor.</p>

<h2>Collaboration, Referencing, and Academic integrity</h2>

<p>This course welcomes open discussion and intellectual
collaboration. For example, you can get help on Piazza and
email from the instructors and your peers.</p>

<p>You are free, in fact, encouraged, to collaborate on problem sets
and projects. <b>However, all answers, code, and any work submitted in
this course must be your (or your team's) own.</b> You must fully
understand and provide your own solutions, rather than blindly
incorporate the solutions from discussion or references.  You are also
explicitly forbidden from looking at another team's code or solution
code from other sources (e.g., from GitHub or CourseHero).</p>

<p>Further, please acknowledge any external sources you referred to
with clear and specific attribution (e.g., "spoke to X and consulted
resource Y [hyperlink] about implementing feature Z"). Each problem
set and programming project will include a prompt to state who you
collaborated with and which resources, possibly on the Internet, that
you consulted. You must be as accurate and complete as possible.</p>

<p><b>Copying software solutions from the web, including from Stack
Overflow, GitHub, or generative AI systems (chatGPT, copilot, ...) is
considered cheating.</b> Posting questions or solutions to quizzes and
programming homeworks to GitHub or question-answering services like
Chegg or public course archives like CourseHero will be considered a
violation of Rutgers and CS Academic Integrity Policy. </p>

<p>In particular, please do not post the solutions to the programming
assignments on GitHub. There are many ways to beef up your software
portfolio to attract employers. Come talk to me for suggestions on
doing this without violating academic integrity.  <b>Posting solution
code publicly in searchable form (e.g. on public GitHub) is a
violation of the academic integrity policy for this course.</b></p>

<p>We will run software to detect plagiarism on all material submitted
by students. Ignorance of academic integrity policies is not
excusable; please ask us if you are ever in doubt. When you work in a
team, and add your name to a submitted piece of software, you accept
responsibility for the integrity of how the software was put
together. You may not simply shift the blame to your teammate.</p>

<p><b>Collaborating on written exams and lecture questions
is a violation of Rutgers integrity policy.</b></p>

<p>You are required to abide strictly by the <a
href="http://nbacademicintegrity.rutgers.edu/home/academic-integrity-policy/">Rutgers
New Brunswick academic integrity policy</a> and also the <a
href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy">Rutgers
Computer Science integrity policy.</a>We will use
sophisticated software to detect plagiarism. Any violations
will be reported to the University's office of student
conduct. Ignorance of integrity policies is not excusable if
you are found in violation. If you are in doubt, please ask
the course staff.</p>

<p>Rutgers University takes academic dishonesty very
seriously. By enrolling in this course, you assume
responsibility for familiarizing yourself with the Academic
Integrity Policy and the possible penalties (including
suspension and expulsion) for violating the policy. As per
the policy, all suspected violations will be reported to the
Office of Student Conduct. Academic dishonesty includes (but
is not limited to): </p>
<ul>
<li>Cheating</li>
<li>Plagiarism </li>
<li>Aiding others in committing a violation or allowing
others to use your work </li>
<li>Failure to cite sources correctly </li>
<li>Fabrication </li>
<li>Using another person’s ideas or words without
attribution, including re-using a previous assignment
Unauthorized collaboration</li>
<li>Sabotaging another student’s work</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are ever in doubt, consult your instructor.</p>

<p><i>Lateness: </i> In general, late submissions to any
component of the course are disallowed unless exempt by
medical or religious reasons allowable by the University or
the explicit permission of the faculty instructor.</p>
