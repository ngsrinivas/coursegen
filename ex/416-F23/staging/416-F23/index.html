<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Computers are everywhere, ranging from our personal laptops,
supercomputers running weather simulations, clusters running data
analytics jobs, our phones, wearable health trackers, and
life-critical devices embedded inside the human body. Beyond the
computers themselves, the primary utility of these machines stems from
the software that runs on them. Making software useful requires
enabling software to interact with humans and realworld signals, while
making it possible for human developers to develop software easily and
allowing multiple applications to share the resources on the same
machine.</p>

<p>Achieving these goals requires applications to interface
effectively with hardware, using the right abstractions that enable
developers to quickly build useful domain-specific logic, and enabling
users to allow multiple applications (whose behaviors are possibly at
odds with each other) to run on the same machine. The <b>operating
system</b> is a crucial layer of software that abstracts and manages
the resources on a machine to meet these requirements.</p>

<p>This course will provide students with a thorough understanding of
the principles and practice of operating systems, by illuminating the
abstractions provided by operating systems, along with how they are
implemented -- including the mechanisms and policies to virtualize
resources such as CPU and memory, dealing with concurrency, and
persisting data failures and reboots. Combining conceptual learning
with immersive project work will endow students with a deep
understanding of this software layer that is foundational to modern
computing. </p>

<h2>Logistics</h2>

<p>This course will use Canvas and Piazza.</p>

<p>Lecture materials and a tentative schedule will be available on the
<a href="syllabus.html">syllabus page.</a></p>

<p>All course announcements will occur on Canvas.</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>Your final course will be based on the following
components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>45% programming projects</li>
  <li>20% weekly quizzes</li>
  <li>15% mid-term exam</li>
  <li>20% final exam</li>
</ul>
  
<p>This course uses absolute grading thresholds; there is no
curve.</p>

<p>Any materials due on a specific day are due at 8 pm Eastern Time on
that day.</p>

<p>The schedules of the programming projects, lectures, and exams are
available on the <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus page.</a>

<p>There will be one mid-term and one final exam. You are allowed a
single letter-paper cheat sheet for referencing during these
exams. The sheet must be handwritten or digitally prepared by you
alone. The mid-term will be in class during lecture hour. The final
exam will be held at the designated time during the finals
period. </p>

<p>In written exam responses, <b>please keep your answers clear and
concise.</b> You will receive 25% of the credit for any question which
you leave blank or clearly write "I don't know". <b>Vague and rambling
answers will receive zero credit.</b> Calculators are allowed.

<p>There are four programming projects. You will work in teams of 2 or
alone, with roughly 3 weeks to finish each project. Under extenuating
circumstances (discretion of the instructor), you can change teams,
but we expect you to stick to the same partner over the semester. The
projects will use the C language and the Linux shell.  You will use a
Linux virtual machine hosted by CS for all the projects. Projects are
released and handed on Canvas. A programming solution and a write-up
(questions detailed under each project) will be required for each
project. </p>

<p>We will provide instructions for packaging and handing in
your programming projects. You must follow these
instructions exactly. If we cannot run your programs, you
will lose a significant portion of points. If you hand in a
programming assignment late, you will lose a significant
fraction of points.</p>

<p>Weekly online quizzes are due on Tuesday every week.  They should
ideally take just 15--30 minutes of your time. We will consider the 10
highest scores among 13 quizzes in total.  Weekly questions are open
book and you may freely consult the materials provided in class
(lectures, textbook, etc.). However, you may not search for answers on
the Internet. No collaboration is permitted. Quizzes are taken and
handed in on Canvas. </p>

<p>In general, late submissions to any component of the course are
disallowed unless exempt by medical or religious reasons allowable by
the University or the explicit permission of the faculty
instructor.</p>

<h2>Collaboration, Referencing, and Academic integrity</h2>

<p>This course welcomes open discussion and intellectual
collaboration. For example, you can get help on Piazza and email from
the instructors and your peers.</p>

<p>You are free, in fact, encouraged, to collaborate on
projects. <b>However, all code, answers, and any work submitted in
this course must be your (or your team's) own.</b> You must fully
understand and provide your own solutions, rather than blindly
incorporate the solutions from discussion or references.  You are also
explicitly forbidden from looking at another team's code or solution
code from other sources (e.g., from GitHub or CourseHero).</p>

<p><b>Copying code from the web, including from Stack Overflow and
GitHub, is considered cheating. Posting exams and programming project
questions or code (problem or solution) on GitHub or Chegg is a
violation of Rutgers and CS Academic Integrity Policy.</b></p>

<p>Each programming project will include a prompt to state who you
collaborated with and which resources, possibly on the Internet, that
you consulted. You must be as thorough and complete as possible.</p>

<p><b>Collaborating on written exams and weekly quizzes is a violation
of Rutgers integrity policy.</b></p>

<p>You are required to abide strictly by the <a
href="http://nbacademicintegrity.rutgers.edu/home/academic-integrity-policy/">Rutgers
New Brunswick academic integrity policy</a> and also the <a
href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/academic-integrity-policy">Rutgers
Computer Science integrity policy.</a> We will use sophisticated
software to detect plagiarism. Any violations will be reported to the
University's office of student conduct. Ignorance of integrity
policies is not excusable if you are found in violation. If you are in
doubt, please ask the course staff.</p>

<p>Rutgers University takes academic dishonesty very seriously. By
enrolling in this course, you assume responsibility for familiarizing
yourself with the Academic Integrity Policy and the possible penalties
(including suspension and expulsion) for violating the policy. As per
the policy, all suspected violations will be reported to the Office of
Student Conduct. Academic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to):
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheating</li>
<li>Plagiarism </li>
<li>Aiding others in committing a violation or allowing
others to use your work </li>
<li>Failure to cite sources correctly </li>
<li>Fabrication </li>
<li>Using another person’s ideas or words without
attribution, including re-using a previous assignment</li>
<li>Unauthorized collaboration</li>
<li>Sabotaging another student’s work</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are ever in doubt, consult your instructor.</p>
